/*
1. Using the umbrella example from the class slide, see if you can follow the example open() method and create the close() method.

const umbrella = {
 color: "pink",
 isOpen: false,
 open: function() {
   if (umbrella.isOpen === true) {
     return "The umbrella is already opened!";
   } else {
     umbrella.isOpen = true;
     return "Julia opens the umbrella!";
   }
  }
};

TIP: Remember to put all of your object's properties and methods inside curly braces: var myObject = { greeting: "hello", name: "Julia" };. Also, remember that an object is just another data type. Just like how you would put a semicolon after a string variable declaration var myString = "hello";, don't forget to put a semi-colon at the end of your object's declaration.

* - Your code should have a variable `umbrella`
* - The variable `umbrella` should be an object

* - Your `umbrella` object should have an `close()` method that toggles the value of `isOpen`

2. Create a breakfast object to represent the following menu item:

The Lumberjack - $9.95
eggs, sausage, toast, hashbrowns, pancakes
The object should contain properties for the name, price, and ingredients.

/*
5. Create an object called facebookProfile. The object should have 3 properties:

your name
the number of friends you have, and
an array of messages you've posted (as strings)
The object should also have 4 methods:

postMessage(message) - adds a new message string to the array
deleteMessage(index) - removes the message corresponding to the index provided
addFriend() - increases the friend count by 1
removeFriend() - decreases the friend count by 1
/*

*/

/*
* QUIZ REQUIREMENTS
* - Your code should have an object `facebookProfile`
* - The `facebookProfile` object should have the `name` (string), `friends` (number), and `messages` (array of strings) property
* - Your `facebookProfile` object should have the `postMessage()`, `deleteMessage()`, `addFriend()` and `removeFriend()` method
* - Carefully implement the desired functionality of each method, as decribed above
*/


// TIP -
// In an array,
// - addition at the end is done using push() method
// - addition at a specific index is done using splice() method
// - deletion from the beginning is done using pop() method
// - deletion from a specific index is done using splice() method
